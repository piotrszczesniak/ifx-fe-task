# Simple Blog

This is a blog application built with React (with Vite) and TypeScript, styled with SCSS. It allows users to view and add blog posts. Update: it also allows to filter posts by author and keyword at the same time.

The application consumes the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch and display blog posts.
